# final-project

I used Heroku. I followed their deployment instructions here:
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#introduction.
Following their directions, I needed to install Pipenv by typing in
'pip install pipenv' at the command line ('winpty pip install pipenv' for
some Windows machines if you installed git bash/MINGW32 in a certain way).

I wanted to be able to allow users to highlight their memos on the calendar
according to category. For instance, maybe a user would want to have important
memos highlight in red. I wasn't able to implement this functionality in time.
